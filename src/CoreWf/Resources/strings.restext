WorkflowInstanceUnloaded=The operation could not be performed because WorkflowInstance '{0}' was unloaded.
WorkflowInstanceUnlocked=The operation could not be performed because WorkflowInstance {0} is unlocked.
WorkflowInstanceUpdatedRecord=TrackRecord= WorkflowInstanceUpdatedRecord, InstanceID = {0}, RecordNumber = {1}, EventTime = {2}, ActivityDefinitionId = {3}, State = {4}, OriginalDefinitionIdentity = {5}, UpdatedDefinitionIdentity = {6}, Annotations = {7}, ProfileName = {8}
WorkflowInstanceUpdateFailed=WorkflowInstance '{0}' could not be updated to identity '{1}'. Review the tracking output for a list of executing activities that could not be updated.
WorkflowMustBeHosted=Please make sure that a Receive activity is hosted within a WorkflowServiceHost.
WorkflowServiceDefinitionIdentityNotMatched=The WorkflowIdentity ('{0}') of the loaded instance does not match any of the hosted WorkflowServices.
WorkflowServiceHostCannotAddOrRemoveServiceDefinitionAfterOpen=WorkflowService definitions cannot be added or removed after the WorkflowServiceHost has been opened, faulted, aborted or closed.
WorkflowTerminatedExceptionDefaultMessage=The workflow was terminated by a Terminate activity.
WorkItemAbortedInstance=An error processing the current work item has caused the workflow to abort.  See the inner exception for details.
WrapperNotSupportedInMessageContract=Custom wrapper names and namespaces are only supported using MessageContracts. Please use a MessageContract type for operation '{0}' in implemented contract '{1}'.
WriteAccessToReadOnlyPublicReference=Activity '{0}' cannot write to this public location reference because it was declared with ArgumentDirection.In. To allow both reading and writing, declare the reference with ArgumentDirection.InOut.
WriteonlyPropertyCannotBeRead=The property or indexer '{0}.{1}' cannot be used in this context because the get accessor is inaccessible.
WrongArgumentType=The argument has the wrong type.  It is of type '{0}' but must be assignable to '{1}'.
WrongCacheMetadataForCodeActivity=The CacheMetadata method which takes an ActivityMetadata parameter must not be called on a CodeActivity or AsyncCodeActivity.  The correct CacheMetadata for these classes takes a CodeActivityMetadata parameter.
WrongCacheMetadataForNativeActivity=The CacheMetadata method which takes an ActivityMetadata parameter must not be called on a NativeActivity.  The correct CacheMetadata for NativeActivity takes a NativeActivityMetadata parameter.
WrongEnvironmentCount=Expected activity '{0}' to have '{1}' argument(s), '{2}' public variable(s), '{3}' private variable(s), and '{4}' runtime delegate argument(s). Actual: '{5}' arguments, '{6}' public variable(s), '{7}' private variable(s), '{8}' runtime delegate argument(s).
WrongMemberCount=IdSpace with owner '{0}' has '{1}' members; expected '{2}'.
WrongNumberOfArgumentsForActivityDelegate=ActivityDelegate arguments don't match. Check your activity configuration to make sure it is in sync with the declared ActivityDelegate.
WrongOnCreateDynamicUpdateMapForNativeActivity=The OnCreateDynamicUpdateMap method which takes an UpdateMapMetadata parameter must not be called on a NativeActivity.  The correct OnCreateDynamicUpdateMap for NativeActivity takes a NativeActivityUpdateMapMetadata parameter.
WrongOriginalEnvironmentCount=Expected the original environment of activity '{0}' to have '{1}' argument(s), '{2}' public variable(s), '{3}' private variable(s), and '{4}' runtime delegate argument(s), for a total of '{5}'. Actual total of locations is '{6}'.
XamlBuildTaskResourceNotFound=The XAML resource expected to be generated by the XAML build task ({0}) was not found. Try rebuilding the project.
XamlElementExpected=Element representation is expected.
XamlElementExpectedAt=Element representation is expected at line ({0}, {1}).
